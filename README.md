# A3Calgorithm
In the Atari Gymnasium KungFuMaster environment, the A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) algorithm was implemented to train an agent in this action-packed martial arts game. A3C utilizes multiple agents running in parallel to explore different parts of the environment, updating a shared model asynchronously.
